This repository contains the code used for duplicate detection. 
The code is split in two, one for jaccard similarity and one for MSM similarity. 
The difference of the codes is the method of calculating the similarity measures used for clustering. Besides this the code functions in the same manner.
Furthermore at the end of the code one can Specify howmany bootstraps are to be run, and over which thresholds can be optimized, using the average_scores function the average scores over the bootstraps can be obtained. 
Furthermore the plotting functions can be used to visualize the results.
